# STUDENTS’ DROPOUT AND SUCCESS RATE PREDICTION USING VARIOUS MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES

This project works to predict the students' dropout and success rate. This helps to find the students who are really in the verge of dropping the course and we can try convinving them to continue the same.

Three Machine Leanrning algorithms has been in this project
1) Random Forest Classifier
2) Support Vector Machine
3) K-Nearest Neighbor
